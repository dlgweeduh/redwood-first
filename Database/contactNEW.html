	<p class="stBlack">The Redwood Project is building a community of great people of all ages and we want to meet you. <a href="mailto:team@redwood-project.com">Leave us your email address</a> so we can get 
	in touch with you personally.</p> 

	<p class="stBlack">The Project itself is currently being offered directly to young adults in high school. If you know a great young person who would be a 
	good fit, let them know about the Project. We also talk directly with school administrators about how the Redwood Project could compliment your current student 
	resources. </p>

<p class="stBlack">If you are interested in learning more about the Project and are a teenager in high school, or have a child who is, we would love to meet you.
</p> 

 <p class="stBlack">If you have any questions or insights send us an email - you will hear back from us within an hour.  The goal is to share the Redwood Project
 and Scott has been meeting parents, teenagers and schools to share tools & ideas and explain how the Project has created a space for teenagers to explore personal 
 leadership in a fun, engaging way and in doing so is filling an important need for families.</p>

<p class="stBlack">To set up your conversation with Scott, contact him directly at <a href="mailto:smalcolm@redwood-project.com">smalcolm@redwood-project.com</a> or <b>416-578-1928</b>.</p>

<p class="stBlack">We look forward to hearing from you,</p>

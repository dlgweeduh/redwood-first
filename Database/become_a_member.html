	<p style="font-size:16px"><b>The Redwood Project provides an experience unlike anything you have done. 
	Start your Redwood story here.</b></p> 
<p>We like to call participants of Redwood Members - because once you join The Project, you are a part of something. A big part of Redwood is investigating the power of choices. Deciding if you want to invest in your own fulfillment by learning the levers that control it, is a good example of such a choice.</p>
<p>Join the Project and impact your life and future in unpredictable and amazing ways. It&rsquo;s that simple. </p>
<p>Of course, it may not be you directly involved in one of our programs, but rather your team, child or staff. As a leader, you are judged by your ability to enhance the well-being and performance of those for whom you are responsible. We can guarantee choosing to deploy Redwood will be a positive choice. </p>
<p>Should you be interested in the possibilities of how Redwood could meet your needs, know that this website attempts to give a broad perspective on a big idea, but the picture only becomes really clear once we are able to sit down and talk with you about the impact Redwood will bring to your family, school or business. </p> 
<p>Finally, participating in one of our programs may not be possible. In that case, we invite you to Join The Project by investigating the ideas shared by Redwood online. Once you consider, discuss, question and engage with this material you will have supported the Redwood Project’s mission to build character and fulfillment through awareness and action. We are psyched to have you on board.</p> 
<p style="font-size:18px;color:grey;">Join the Project. Grow Big.</p>
